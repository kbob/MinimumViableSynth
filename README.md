# MinimumViableSynth

A virtual analog synthesizer with lots of knobs and buttons.

This is a polyphonic, monotimbral, virtual analog synth.  The audio
engine runs as an Apple Audio Unit on a Macintosh.  The control panel,
shown here, will provide dedicated controls for most of the synth's
functions.

## Status

The audio engine has been stable since January, though it does not
exactly match the front panel's feature set.  Current effort is on
producing a MIDI controller that looks like the front panel.  Printed
circuit boards for most of the modules are designed, and the LFO
and Controllers modules have been fabricated and tested.
