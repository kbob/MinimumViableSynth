This is a spreadsheet in Apple Numbers format.  (Proprietary, but I
like it.)

Each SPI bus's signals can be mapped to several pins.  Those are
recorded.

The 144 pin chip does not bring out pins PH2 and above.  Those are
shaded red.

Most of the pins are connected to a peripheral on the STM32F429IDISCOVERY
board.  The pins that are not used are shaded blue in the spreadsheet.
Some, but not all, of the used pins are labeled in the Discovery column.

The notes column shows how I plan to use the pins, especially the
SPI slave select pins.
